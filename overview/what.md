# What's MMS \(Microservices\)?

1. A _microservice_ is a service with design focus on the _smallest autonomous boundary_ 
2. It’s built, deployed and run _independently_ from other services 
3. It manages its own _information_ and the way it _communicates_ with the _outside world_ 
4. It handles _failures_ so that its information isn’t lost
