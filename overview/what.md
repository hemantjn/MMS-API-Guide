# What's MMS \(Microservices\)?

1. A microservice is a service with a design focus toward the smallest autonomous boundary
2. It’s built, deployed and run independently from other services
3. It manages its own information and how it communicates to/ from the outside world
4. It handles failures so that its information isn’t lost
